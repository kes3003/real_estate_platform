# Capability: Cylindrical Direct-to-Object Printing

## Overview
Sun Studio provides cylindrical direct-to-object printing for brands and businesses that require high-quality, durable printing directly onto round, curved, or contoured objects.

This service enables printing directly onto the object surface without labels, sleeves, or wraps, allowing the design to become part of the object itself.

## What Makes This Capability Distinct
- Full 360-degree wrap-around printing
- Direct printing on transparent glass without a barrier layer
- Precise alignment on curved and tapered objects
- Consistent results across production runs
- High adhesion and durability when paired with proper surface preparation

## Objects Commonly Printed
- Perfume and fragrance bottles
- Candle jars and glass vessels
- Tumblers and drinkware
- Cosmetic containers
- Specialty cylindrical packaging

## Supported Materials (Subject to Testing)
- Clear glass
- Colored glass
- Metal
- Wood
- Plastic
- Paper-based cylindrical items

## Dimensional Constraints (Reference Limits)
- Maximum item diameter: 6 inches (152 mm)
- Minimum item diameter: 1.5 inches (38 mm)
- Maximum item length: 18 inches (457 mm)
- Maximum taper angle: +10° / -2°

## Print Characteristics
- Helical printing method for seamless wrap-around graphics
- Diameter-independent resolution to maintain consistent image quality
- Multi-layer printing supported
- Tactile and faux-embossed effects possible
- Ink is pinned during printing and UV-cured after completion

## Typical Use Cases
- Luxury fragrance and cosmetics packaging
- Retail and promotional products
- Personalized or limited-edition items
- Prototyping, sampling, and small-to-medium production runs

## Important Conditions
- All materials require testing before production
- Adhesion and durability depend on substrate and surface preparation
- Pretreatment may be required depending on material

## What This Capability Does Not Promise
- No guaranteed adhesion without testing
- No universal compatibility across all shapes or materials
- No color guarantees without approved samples

## Internal Reference
This capability is enabled using the LSINC PeriOne industrial direct-to-object printing system.
